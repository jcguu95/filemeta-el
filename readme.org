A list of helps/contributions wanted.

+ [ ] Add a nice filemeta shower.
+ [ ] Can I do it functionally without explicitly copy the whole
  struct?
+ [ ] Add a documentation.
+ [ ] "comments" are just a testing feature. filemeta-comment.el
  should be rewritten mimicking filemeta-tag.el by using more
  utils and functional programming techniques. Also consider add
  timestamps for the slot filemeta-comments.
